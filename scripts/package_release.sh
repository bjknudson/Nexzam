# them. Harmless locally since this path is ad-hoc signed rather than
# notarized, but it keeps local and CI builds structurally identical --
# and keeps the .app ~10MB smaller.

# `tauri build`'s own ad-hoc signing does not produce a valid
# resource-sealed signature once the frozen Python backend is bundled
# under Contents/Resources: `codesign --verify --deep --strict` fails
# with "code has no resources but signature indicates they must be
# present", and a downloaded copy is reported by Gatekeeper as
# "damaged" rather than merely from an unidentified developer. A local,
# un-quarantined copy launches fine regardless, because that stricter
# check only runs on quarantined files -- which is why it never
# reproduces with a same-machine copy.
#
# Sign with the same script CI uses, so this path exercises the real
# signing logic. "-" means ad-hoc: fine for local testing, but ad-hoc
# signatures cannot be notarized, so builds from this script still show
# the unidentified-developer prompt. Releases come from the workflow.
